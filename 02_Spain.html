    <h1>Spain</h1>

    <h2>Geography</h2>

    <body>
        <p>Spain occupies most of the Iberian Peninsula, stretching south from the Pyrenees Mountains to the Strait of Gibraltar, which 
            separates Spain from Africa. To the east lies the Mediterranean Sea, including Spain's Balearic Islands. Spain also rules 
            two cities in North Africa and the Canary Islands in the Atlantic.</p>

        <p>Spain is a storied country of stone castles, snowcapped mountains, vast monuments, and sophisticated cities, all of
            which have made it a favoured travel destination. <b>The country is geographically and culturally diverse. </b>Its heartland
            is the Meseta, a broad central plateau half a mile above sea level. Much of the region is traditionally given over to cattle
            ranching and grain production; it was in this rural setting that Miguel de Cervantes’s <i>Don Quixote</i> tilted at the tall
            windmills that still dot the landscape in several places.</p>

        <p> In the country’s northeast are the broad valley of the Ebro River, the mountainous region of Catalonia, and the hilly
            coastal plain of Valencia. To the northwest is the Cantabrian Mountains, a rugged range in which heavily forested, rainswept 
            valleys are interspersed with tall peaks. To the south is the citrus-orchard-rich and irrigated lands of the valley of
            the Guadalquivir River, celebrated in the renowned lyrics of Spanish poets Federico García Lorca and Antonio
            Machado; over this valley rises the snowcapped Sierra Nevada. The southern portion of the country is desert, an
            extension of the Sahara made familiar to Americans through the “spaghetti western” films of the 1960s and early ’70s.
            Lined with palm trees, rosemary bushes, and other tropical vegetation, the southeastern Mediterranean coast and the
            Balearic Islands enjoy a gentle climate, drawing millions of visitors and retirees, especially from northern Europe.</p>

    <h2>Natural Features</h2>

    <body>
        <p> The interior of Spain is a high, dry plateau surrounded and crisscrossed by mountain ranges. Rivers run to the coasts, 
            creating good farmland. Still, the interior of the country gets very hot in summer and very cold and dry in the winter. 
            Droughts are common. Plants and trees grow so well on the northwestern coast, in Galicia and along the Bay of Biscay,
            that the area is called Green Spain. Rain, trapped by the mountains farther inland, is frequent. Beech and oak trees
            flourish here.</p>
        <p> Numerous coves and inlets break up the coastline. The southern and eastern coasts of Spain, from the fertile Andalusian
            plain up to the Pyrenees, are often swept by warm winds called sirocco winds. These winds originate in northern Africa
            and keep temperatures along the Mediterranean coast milder than the interior.</p>
